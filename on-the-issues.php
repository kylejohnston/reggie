					<h2>Job Creation</h2>
					<p>Job creation should be a top priority for the federal government. More jobs mean more workers contributing to a stronger economy. Congress should also balance worker rights and protections with business concerns of competition and cost. Sacriﬁcing one at the expense of the other damages the whole economy.</p>
					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>The federal government should foster conditions for the highest quality education available in the world. From pre-school through advanced studies, government should provide easy access for all who desire to learn.</p>
					<h2>Social Security &amp; Medicare</h2>
					<p>Our seniors deserve security. Because of this our entitlement policy should be “hands off, don’t touch it”. Any reform opens the door to more reform. These programs must be maintained.</p>
					<h2>Health Care</h2>
					<p>It is a national tragedy for any citizen to live without health care insurance in this country. Everyone needs health care. No one should lose all they have because they get sick, are injured or disabled.</p>
